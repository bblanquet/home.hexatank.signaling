## 1.1 Architecture

HEXA Tank is a web-based real-time strategy game that presented several complex development challenges, including:
<br>
- Creating a procedural map generator.
- Implementing a pathfinder for unit movement.
- Developing an artificial intelligence system.
- Designing a real-time recorder for game statistics.
- Ensuring a user-friendly UI.
- Implementing a multiplayer mode (peer-to-peer).

I successfully tackled these challenges by leveraging advanced algorithms, design patterns, modular and reusable components,
and an object-oriented programming paradigm.
